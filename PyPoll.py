#In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run: 
#Total number of votes cast
#A complete list of candidates who received votes
#Total number of votes each candidate received
#Percentage of votes each candidate won
#The winner of the election based on popular vote

import datetime as dt
now = dt.datetime.now()

print("The time right now is ", now)
